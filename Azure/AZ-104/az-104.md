# 1. Prerequisites for Azure Admins

## Azure Policy

Example of a Compute policy that only allow specific virtual machine SKUs:

```JSON
{
    "if": {
        "allOf": [
            {
                "field": "type",
                "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
            },
            {
                "not": {
                    "field": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/sku.name",
                    "in": "[parameters('listOfAllowedSKUs)]"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "then": {
        "effect": "Deny"
    }
}
```

### Apply Azure policy

Adding the `Microsoft.PolicyInsights` extension:

```PowerShell
# Register the resoruce provider if it's not already registered
Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNameSpace 'Microsoft.PolicyInsights'
```

Once we have registered the provider, we can create a policy assignment. E.g., here is a policy definition that identifies virtual machines not using managed disks:

```PowerShell
# Get a reference to the resource group that will be the scope of the assignment
$rg = Get-AzResourceGroup -Name '<resourceGroupName>'

# Get a reference to the built-in policy definition that will be assigned
$definition = Get-AzPolicyDefinition | Where-Object { $_.Properties.DisplayName -eq 'Audit VM that do not use managed disks' }

# Create the policy assignment with the built-in deinition against your resource group
New-AzPolicyAssignment -Name 'audit-vm-manageddisks' -DisplayName 'Audit VMs without managed disks Assignment' -Scope $rg.ResourceId -PolicyDefinition $definition
```

Four Key parameters when creating and assigning policy:

- Name: The actual name of the assignment. For above example, `audit-vm-manageddisks` was used
- DisplayName: Display name for the policy assignment. For above example, you're using `Audit VMs wihtout managed disks Assignment`.
- Definition: The policy definition, based on which you're using to create the assignment. In above case, it's the ID of policy definition Audit VMs that do not use managed disks.
- Scope: A scope determines what resources or grouping of resources the policy assignment gets enforced on. It could range from a subscription to resource groups. Be sure to replace `<scope>` with the name of your resource group.

### Remove a policy assignment

Can be done in Portal, or through PowerShell command `Remove-AzPolicyAssignment`, with Name, Scope as parameters.
