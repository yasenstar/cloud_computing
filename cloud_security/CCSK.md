## 01. Cloud Computing Concepts and Architectures

Standard:

- ISO/IEC 17789
- NIST 800-145
- NIST 500-292

When most people think of the cloud, they think of how "cheap" it is in comparison to the traditional IT structure. While cloud computing can be (but is not always) cheaper because of economies of scale at the provider's side, cloud comsumers must appreciate that the provider cannot be everthing to everyone (that is, the CSP cannot meet everyone's security policies). As a result, you need to be very aware of the __shared responsibilities__ thatcome with any potential cost saving.

Cloud Computing's potential benefits:

- Agility
- Resiliency
- Economy

As a result, organizations can:

- move faster: no hardware purchase and racking/stacking servers
- reduce downtime: if architected to taek advantage of elasticity and other cloud characteristics
- save money: no capital expenses, and operational expenditures can be reduced by right-sizing server specs and quantity on the fly to meet actual demand
